<h1>Example project that reads design tokens</h1>

Project with UIKit that uses design tokens on some sample components

This project contains tokens generated by the [figma-token-engine](https://github.com/d01000100/figma-token-engine) (ios-swift/classes.swift format) and uses them to style sample components

## Recommendations:

<ul>
<li>Associate source code repository before downloading the app from the Preferences option:</li>
<li>Source Control/Git: https://github.com/d01000100/uikit-tokens-tests</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When compiling the project in the app target it is recommended to use a device with iOS 13 or higher.</li>

<li>Consider having the latest Xcode update</li>
</ul>

## How is the token setup created?

1. From XCode, create the Group (folder) where the tokens will be at
2. Configure the FTE to just output `ios-swift/class.swift` format and the `outputDir` to the folder created in step 1
3. After the files are generated, they need to be added to the XCode project. You can do that from File > Add Files to "myApp"

### Using the Storyboard UI

You can add additional ["color catalogues"](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/managing-assets-with-asset-catalogs) that add them to the color selects on the Storyboard Properties interface, but we can't relate them to tokens.

Pending more research

### Using the Controller

1. Add the graphical elements of the screen on the storyboard
2. Add the outlets of all the elements to the controller
3. On the `viewDidLoad` function, style the components using the tokens [example code](./MyProyectStoryboard/TokenShowcase/TokenShowcaseController.swift)

### Adding font styles

1. Add the font files (e.g. .ttf) to the project, by dragging and dropping them from Finder
2. In the [Info.plist], add to the field "Information Property List" the property "Fonts provided by application". Add an entry for each font file, setting the value to the font file names: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/text_display_and_fonts/adding_a_custom_font_to_your_app]
3. In the view controller, you create a new UIFont object, specifying the font file you want to use (in my case, combination of font family and font weigt) and the font size needed.
4. You assign that UIFont object to the View you want to style
5. [Example file](./MyProyectStoryboard/TokenShowcase/TokenShowcaseController.swift)

**Caveats**

- There no letter spacing
- The font weight is not a number, it's attached to the Font name (the .ttf file).

## TODO

- [ ] Styling shadows
- [ ] See how to respond to system dark/light modes
- [ ] Explore more how to add to the *color catalogues*, to see if we can associate tokens to them
- [ ] Explore if there is an equivalent to catalogues for font styles
